# jupyter

This project's CI pipeline builds and pushes a [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) image into the GitLab Container Registry.

It can be pulled for use in Security Automation ML projects to provide a containerized JupyterLab environment to enable one to code and run training experiments. It enables you to run any of the Python files or notebooks within this repository on JupyterLab, and includes common python ML libraries e.g numpy, pandas, tensorflow.
